Learning C#
===========

Repo to hold any test code used while getting to grips with C#
This was previously hosted on bitbucket as a mercurial repo, but I've migrated it over (manually, it seemed to take too long for such a small number of files to use a tool).

- HelloWorld: A basic application that does some verification over the text input and ensures it gets a persons name, with or without a middle name.

- LearningWindows: Another basic application that will launch a window, cleanly exit and also display a pop-up.

- Distribution: Project to package and generate .exe/.msi files for the other projects
